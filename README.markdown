## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Where do I get the development-version? ###

I use git for my own development. You can find the Trunk-version on [GitHub](https://github.com/wwerther/Win7HelpdeskGadget).
It includes also a small bash script (I develop Win7-Scripts using Linux. Strange isn't it?) to build a .Gadget file from the source-tree

### Are there known bugs? ###

Yes, I'm sure, that there are bugs. Please let me know if you find one.


### Is there a Roadmap? ###

Yes, there is kind of a roadmap. But the order depends on my time.

* maybe add a function to have shared favorites amongst different users using a global JSON-store
